# Reboot-Checker
This script is being developed with the intent of saving time when doing a maintenance preparation that involves a reboot of a Linux server. The same things get checked, so lets automate this. I'm cutting my teeth with bash scripting and each section could probably use a little bit of polishing, so any help or contribution would be greatly appreciated.
